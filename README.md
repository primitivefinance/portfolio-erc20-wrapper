# Portfolio ERC20 Wrapper

Wrap Portfolio liquidity pool tokens into ERC20!

## Why?

Portfolio positions are represented as ERC1155 tokens, this wrapper allows you to wrap one or multiple of these tokens into a single ERC20 token.

## How does it work?

Wrappers are deployed via the factory wrapper.

## Notes

Random features / ideas:
- [x] Wrap 1 or many ERC1155 tokens into a single ERC20 token
- [ ] Should we allow different weights depending on the pool id?
